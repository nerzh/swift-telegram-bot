In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.
/// If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token. If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content.
